# Mappin

A web-based tool for visualizing glacier ice flow velocity data from NASA's [ITS_LIVE](https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov/) (Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation) project.

## Features

- **Interactive map and time series charting** for exploring ice velocity across decades of data
- **Shareable URLs** that encode the full application state, providing a live velocity plot that can be referenced or embedded in papers
- **CSV export** for offline analysis

## Attributions

Velocity data generated using auto-RIFT (Gardner et al., 2018) and provided by the NASA MEaSUREs [ITS_LIVE](https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov/) project (Gardner et al., 2025).
